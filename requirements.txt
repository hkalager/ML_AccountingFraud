# Project requirements for ML_AccountingFraud
# Core dependencies used by the code in this repository
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
scikit-learn==1.3.2
imbalanced-learn==0.12.0
statsmodels

# Optional / developer tools (uncomment to install)
# jupyter
# seaborn

# Notes:
# - These two packages are pinned to match your conda `base` environment:
#     scikit-learn==1.3.2
#     imbalanced-learn==0.12.0
# - To create a conda environment and install compatible packages, we recommend
#   using conda-forge which resolves binary and dependency issues, e.g.:
#     conda create -n ml-fraud python=3.10
#     conda activate ml-fraud
#     conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn==1.3.2 imbalanced-learn==0.12.0 statsmodels
# - If you prefer pip, install with:
#     pip install -r requirements.txt
#   but be aware that some combinations of scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn
#   may be incompatible when installed via pip; prefer conda-forge if you
#   encounter import errors related to imblearn/sklearn internals.
